  <h1> PalTech </h1>

### Idea:
The main idea of this website came from the need to find a better way to reach the technicians that we need to do some jobs here and there, its like making a place where you can find all the available painters to paint your doors and all the builders to fix your wall with all thier required information.

### Site Overview:
The main goal of this project is to make connection between technicians (e.g. painter, plumber,electrician, builder, etc.) and people who are looking for a technician in a specific field to do some tasks for them.
<br>
This will be done by building a website that allows technicians to register and upload their information including years of experience and other related information that
may help the other side in their selection.

### Functional Requirements:
* Login and registration. A user can register and login either as a technician or as a normal
user (seeker).
