## Idea:
The main idea of this website came from the need to find a better way to reach the technicians that we need to do some jobs here and there, its like making a place where you can find all the available painters to paint your doors and all the builders to fix your wall with all thier required information.

## Site Overview:
The main goal of this project is to make connection between technicians (e.g. painter, plumber,electrician, builder, etc.) and people who are looking for a technician in a specific field to do some tasks for them.
<br>
This will be done by building a website that allows technicians to register and upload their information including years of experience and other related information that
may help the other side in their selection.

## Functional Requirements:
* Login and registration. A user can register and login either as a technician or as a normal
user (seeker).
* As a technician, user will have a profile page that includes all his information some of which will be already entered in the registration form while other information could be added later. User will be also able to edit his profile information.
* As a seeker, user will be able to submit a request to contact a technician, review technicians after the completion of the task. A seeker will also has a profile and can edit his information.
* A seeker could search for a technician by filtering or through a search box.
* Users can also enter the website as guests. They will be able to search for technicians without having to register but with some limitations to other functionalities such as submitting requests and making reviews.
